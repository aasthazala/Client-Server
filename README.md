# Client-Server
This is a simple client-server project. This project is based on Advanced System Programming. This messaging system uses socket programming.
Socket Programming:
A socket is an endpoint of a two-way communication link between two different programs running on the network.

A socket is a communications connection point (endpoint) that you can name and address in a network. Socket programming shows how to use socket APIs to establish communication links between remote and local processes.

Socket Programming provides the ability to implement real time analytic, instant messaging, binary streaming, and document collaboration.
